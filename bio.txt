<p>I am a programmer from Pittsburgh, seeking work in a professional software development enviornment in the DC area.</p>

<p>By May, I will have an Associates Degree in Software Development from CCAC. My experience covers working	with various operating systems, integrated development enviornments and applications.</p>

<p>My first real programming projects were simple, mostly cli applicatoins around 2010. This was back when I only knew C, Assembly and a little C++. The first game I ever wrote was in C, with linked assembly functions for raw VGA output.</p>
